1. Low Fidelity Prototype and High Fidelity Prototype. 
A Low Fidelity Prototype is a rough, basic representation of a product or idea used early in the design process to test core concepts, while a High Fidelity Prototype is a detailed, refined representation used later in the process to test and refine the user experience.
1.0.	 Introduction
Epic East Africa is a website where you can explore some of the most beautiful places in East Africa. From mountains and rivers to lakes and game parks, this site showcases top destinations across the region. Whether you’re looking for travel ideas or just want to see what East Africa has to offer, Epic East Africa makes it easy to browse, learn, and get inspired for your next adventure.

In the high-fidelity prototype of Epic East Africa, I implemented a functional navigation system with added interactions and smooth transitions. The sidebar provides easy access to the main sections—Home, Destinations, and Contact. By connecting each link to the relevant page, I created a seamless browsing experience.
When you click on any sidebar link, actions and transitions take you smoothly to the corresponding page, such as Home for the main gallery, Destinations for detailed travel spots, or Contact to reach out. This setup helps users move naturally through the site, making navigation quicker and the user experience smoother.
